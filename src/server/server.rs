//! # Server Core - Image Encryption Service
//!
//! The core server component is responsible for ONE thing: performing steganography
//! encryption on images. It receives task requests and returns encrypted images.
//!
//! All distributed system concerns (leader election, heartbeats, task distribution, etc.)
//! are handled by the [`ServerMiddleware`](super::middleware::ServerMiddleware).
