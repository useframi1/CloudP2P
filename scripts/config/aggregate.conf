# CloudP2P Metrics Aggregation Configuration
#
# This file configures the metrics collection from all client machines
# and aggregates them into a single report.

# Output directory for aggregated reports
OUTPUT_DIR="./aggregated_metrics"

# Array of client machines and their metrics paths
# Format: "user@host:/path/to/metrics"
#
# The script will use SCP to collect metrics/*.json from each machine
CLIENT_MACHINES=(
    "user@192.168.1.20:/root/CloudP2P/metrics"
    "user@192.168.1.21:/root/CloudP2P/metrics"
    "user@192.168.1.22:/root/CloudP2P/metrics"
)

# Notes:
# 1. Ensure SSH key-based authentication is configured for all client machines
# 2. The metrics directory should contain JSON files generated by stress tests
# 3. Files should follow the pattern: machine_{n}_client_{i}.json
# 4. The script will collect all .json files from the specified paths
# 5. Make sure the paths exist on the client machines before running aggregation
